	The root component is the base component of the application. It is the only component that is always displayed
	and its template contains the router-outlet directive. The router-outlet directive is the where the Angular router
	places whatever component should be displayed based upon the current url path. Its template is also where the 
	HTML for the application's navigation bar is defined. This is why the component's class body contains several methods 
	that relate the navigation bar functionality, such as logging out.

	The root component is also an important location for registering providers. Any angular services that are intended 
	to be singletons across the application should be placed in the root components list of providers. The root component
	is only ever initialized once by the application, which in turn means that the classes in the providers list will only
	ever be created once.
